# TicTacToe-Bot
it's a project where you play against an AI opponent that uses a MiniMax algorithm to find the best move of each position.
As the bot has to check every possible moves from every position, it may take a few seconds to play the initial moves.

# Mini-Max algorithm
The Mini-Max algorithm uses a recursive function to examine all possible outcomes and their corresponding paths, selecting moves that produce the best results.
